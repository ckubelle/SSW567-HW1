SSW 567 - HW 1 - Christian Kubelle

The only challenge I encountered with this assignment had to deal with rounding errors. I included an example of a right triangle which caused a lot of rounding issues. Other that that I did not have any. The requirements were sufficient for this assignment. I was not sure how many bugs to include so I only included one. It was hard for me to tell if you'd prefer us to include bugs. I didn't encounter any challenges with using the tools because the sample code helped give me an example of how to write the test cases. I tried to do boundary value analysis to test each test case. I gave multiple examples of each type of triangle. I also wasn't sure if we needed to include different test cases other than just assertEquals.
